# Welcome to Energy On Chain's "limit-order-bot-template"!

## [ DESCRIPTION ]
No limit order available on your exchange? No problem. This bot was made to extend the functionality of CEFI exchanges that either don't offer an option for placing limit orders, or don't provide the desired level of customizability. You can use this bot with the exchanges that are already featured in the repo, or take it a step further and add your own. 

## [ STACK ]
- Python (key packages include pandas, numpy, schedule)
- Google Cloud Services (for pulling and storing real-time data)

## [ BACKGROUND ]
This project is an example of how Energy On Chain can enhance client trading performance by building / increasing the number of trading tools that they have at their disposal. If you have a similar situation where you are limited in what you want to do on CEXes (or DEXes), don't hesitate to get in touch!
